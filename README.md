This bot is very easy to use, and can be used for more than just capybara!

## Installation
Step 1: Make sure you have node.js and npm installed
Step 2: Run the command `npm install` (once, will install all required files.)
Step 3: Create a discord bot and put the bot token and id in the config.json file
Step 4: Run the command `npm run dc` (ONLY RUN THIS ONCE, THIS CREATES THE COMMANDS ON YOUR BOT)

## Running the bot
Just run `npm run start` and this will check if the bot is up to date, and start the bot!

## Adding/removing pictures
All images that the bot uses are in the images folder, you can delete images there, or add them :D

## How to setup bot
This bot is made for multi-guild usage, so you can use it on more than just 1 server! You can set the channel to post the capybara pictures with the command /setchannel
Important: Only people with ADMINISTRATOR permissions can run this command
